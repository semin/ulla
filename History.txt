== 0.0.5 2009-1-23

* 4 major enhancement:
  * Egor warns if your sigma value is too big for any amino acid count (minimum ratio of amino acid count to sigma value: 500.0)
  * --augosigma option was added to avoid excessive influence of background frequencies
  * a bug in p2 probability calculation of the partial smoothing procedure was fixed
  * a bug in total probability/log odds ratio calculation was fixed

* 4 minor enhancement:
  * --noround option was added to get original log odds ratios
  * --p1smooth option was added to enable p1 probability smoothing when partial smoothing
  * default verbosity has been changed from ERROR to WARN
  * codes were refactored to be more human readable and DRY

== 0.0.4 2008-12-15

* 2 major enhancement:
  * log-odds ratio matrices can be generated with --nosmooth option
  * safe handling for zero observations or mutations of amino acids

== 0.0.3 2008-12-09

* 2 major enhancement:
  * An option '--cys (-j) 2' added not to distinguish J from C, so 'disulphide bond' environment feature is not prerequisite
  * Masking works for target amino acid, too

== 0.0.2 2008-11-13

* 2 major enhancement:
  * Constrained environment features are properly handled
  * Sane log-odds ratio matrices are produced

== 0.0.1 2008-11-07

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Initial release
