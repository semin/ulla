== 0.9.9 09/08/2009

* Changed default value for --classdef option from 'classdef.dat' to nil
  When no definition file provided, --cys (-y) 2 and --nosmooth options are applied automatically

== 0.9.8 21/07/2009

* Fixed a bug in generating amino acids symbols when --cys 2 is set

== 0.9.7 30/05/2009

* Added --environment option to consider not only substituted amino acids' environments but also substituting amino acids' environments
* Changed the default pseudocount, (1 / # of environment classes) to 0, a pseudocount needs to be explicitly provided with --add option
* Changed the fixed column size (7) of raw count matrices to vary depending on the number of digits of a maximum amino acid count
* Fixed a bug in reading an environment feature definition file (empty line)

== 0.9.6 18/03/2009

* Warns if Rmagick is not properly installed or missing.

== 0.9.5 18/03/2009

* Fixed a bug in the order of requiring libraries

== 0.9.4 18/03/2009

== 0.9.3 23/2/2009

* Egor has been renamed to Ulla!

== 0.9.0 13/2/2009

* Added --heatmap option for heat map generation from substitution tables
* Added --heatmap-format option for heat map figure format (PNG, GIF, JPG, BMP, and PDF)
* Added --heatmap-stem option to set a file name of total heat maps figure when --heatmap 1 or 2 is set
* Added --heatmap-columns option to set the number of tables in a row when --heatmap 1 or 2 is set
* Added --heatmap-values option to print values in the cells of heat maps
* Renamed --noround option to --noroundoff
* 'simple_memoize' RubyGem package is no longer required

== 0.0.5 23/1/2009

* Warns if your sigma value is too big for any amino acid count (minimum ratio of amino acid count to sigma value: 500.0)
* Added --augosigma option to avoid excessive influence of background frequencies
* Added --noround option was added to get original log odds ratios
* Added --p1smooth option was added to enable p1 probability smoothing when partial smoothing
* Fixed a bug in p2 probability calculation of the partial smoothing procedure
* Fixed a bug in total probability/log odds ratio calculation
* Changed default verbosity from ERROR to WARN
* Refactored codes to be more human readable and DRY

== 0.0.4 15/12/2008

* Fixed a bug to generated log-odds ratio matrices with --nosmooth option
* Copes with no observations or mutations

== 0.0.3 09/12/2008

* Added --cys (-j) 2 not to distinguish J from C, so 'disulphide bond' environment feature is not prerequisite
* Fixed a bug to make masking works for target amino acid, too

== 0.0.2 13/11/2008
